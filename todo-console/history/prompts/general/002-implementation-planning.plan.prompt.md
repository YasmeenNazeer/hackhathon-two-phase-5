## Prompt

approve and start planning

## Response snapshot

I have created the implementation plan (`specs/plan.md`) which outlines the layered architecture, core interfaces for the `TaskService`, and the definition of done for Phase 1.

## Outcome

- ✅ Impact: Strategic path for implementation established.
- 🧪 Tests: No execution; plan is conceptual.
- 📁 Files: `specs/plan.md` created.
- 🧠 Reflection: Layered approach will simplify testing and future persistence migration.

## Evaluation notes (flywheel)

- Failure modes observed: None
- Graders run and results (PASS/FAIL): N/A
- Prompt variant (if applicable): N/A
- Next experiment (smallest change to try): N/A
